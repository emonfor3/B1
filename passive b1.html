    <h1>Understanding the Passive Voice</h1>
    <p>Passive voice is a grammatical construction where the object of the verb becomes the subject. It is commonly used to emphasize the action rather than the subject or when the subject is unknown or unimportant. In this tutorial, we will cover the passive voice for all tenses and provide examples and practice exercises.</p>
